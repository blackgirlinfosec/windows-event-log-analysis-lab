# 🧪 Windows Event Log Analysis Lab

## 🔍 What This Lab Is About
I used a virtual machine running Windows 10 and Microsoft Sentinel to analyze security logs. I focused on things like failed logins and PowerShell commands that could mean something suspicious is happening.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to read event logs
- How to create KQL queries
- What attackers might do with PowerShell
- How to spot patterns using real logs

## 🛠 Tools I Used
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Azure Virtual Machine
- Sysmon
- KQL (Kusto Query Language)

## 🗂 Coming Soon
I will upload:
- Screenshots from the lab
- KQL queries I wrote
- Notes from my attack simulations
